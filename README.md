# Accent-Web

This is a tool that aims to provide Japanese learners a tool to add furigana and accent marks to articles.

## Features

- Adds furigana and accent marks automatically to Japanese plain text, which can also be edited manually
- The formatted text can be copied as html format to render on HackMD with our HackMD Japanese accent marking css snippet `@OrangeSagoCream/AccentMarker`, or be downloaded as .pdf or .png file

## Installation

Install all packages with [bun](https://bun.com/):

```bash
bun i
```

## Set up dev server

Local development and `vite preview` use a same-origin proxy for `/api/mark-accent`.

If you have an API key, add it to `.env` and requests will go directly to the real upstream API:

```bash
MARK_ACCENT_API_KEY=<our_api_key>
```

You can optionally override the direct upstream host too:

```bash
MARK_ACCENT_UPSTREAM_URL=https://api.sessatakuma.dev/api/MarkAccent/
```

Do not set `MARK_ACCENT_UPSTREAM_URL` to this app's own `/api/mark-accent` URL. That makes the proxy call itself recursively.

Without a local API key, the proxy falls back to the public host:

```text
https://accent-marker.hsichen.dev
```

If you need to point dev at a different public API host, add this to `.env`:

```bash
VITE_MARK_ACCENT_API_URL=https://accent-marker.sessatakuma.dev
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Add `MARK_ACCENT_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the Vercel project settings.
3. Optionally add `MARK_ACCENT_UPSTREAM_URL` if the direct upstream API host changes.
4. Deploy with the default Vite build settings.

`MARK_ACCENT_UPSTREAM_URL` must point to the real upstream API, not this app's `/api/mark-accent` route.

In production, the frontend calls `/api/mark-accent`, and Vercel forwards the request server-side so the API key is not exposed to the browser.
